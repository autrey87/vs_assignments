        There are times that we all find ourselvves procrastinating for no good reason. Then there are times when the whole world holds it's collective breath.. The reason for ignoring my important school work last night was certainly the latter.
        Admittedly, I did it to myself when I opened my oh-so-addictive, portable <span>Twitter Machine</span>, but feelings of shame melted away when I was immediately greeted with the trending hashtags and topics <span>WWIII</span>, <span>Trump Kills Iranian General</span>, and <span>China and Russia</span>
        filled my feed.</p></main>
